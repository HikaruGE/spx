Indexing and Resolving symbol:
===================================


1. It is no longer required to annotate scope with symbols . While adding to the symbol-table, additional information such as, origin is already stored. 

2. While resolving symbol, one should specify the search origin. Resolving symbols starts from the specified search origin and traverse the enclosing namespace 
until it reaches the root of the symbol-table. 

3. In addition, all the enclosed namespaces inside Search-origin namespace are taken into consideration during symbol-resolving.
